Big Data, Cloud & ML Tools Dominate: Skills like PySpark, Databricks, GCP, and scikit-learn lead in pay, reflecting strong demand for cloud-based analytics and machine learning expertise.

DevOps & Engineering Knowledge Pays: High salaries are linked to tools like GitLab, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and Bitbucketâ€”showing value in analysts who can work in production-grade data environments.

Versatility Wins: Top earners often know multiple languages (Python, Scala, Go), collaborate well (Atlassian, Notion), and manage complex data systems (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch).
